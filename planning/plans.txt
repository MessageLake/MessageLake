Next:
Database / Models for persisted data
  messages, authors, tags
Use relevance matrix locate related messages given terms


Later:
Author names are tags
  "Private" tag means only tagged author(s) can see it
save/load feeds
  feeds table
Tags carry more weight, but all message text is searchable
  Tags and terms are different because the text is searchable


Implemented:
relevancy parameter in feed search (frontend)


For Learning:
Created auth server that connects with Okta
Auth server uses Okta (via ExpressOIDC) to protect the service
Lake needs to use Auth as middleware in the same way that Auth uses ExpressOIDC...
  Simpler would be having Lake use Okta, but this is for learning
