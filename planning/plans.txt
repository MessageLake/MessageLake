Database / Models for persisted data
  messages, authors, tags

Refactor to Promises or async/await
  Choose wisely

Do I want to return a message with all responses?
Body:
  {
    "type": "Success",
    "message": "Succesfully saved author to db",
    "payload": {
      "author": "Friedrich Schiller"
    }
  }

Use relevance matrix locate related messages given terms


Later:
Author names are tags
  "Private" tag means only tagged author(s) can see it
save/load feeds
  feeds table
Tags carry more weight, but all message text is searchable
  Tags and terms are different because the text is searchable


Implemented:
relevancy parameter in feed search (frontend)
