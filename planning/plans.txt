Db Connection and functions async/await

Write tests for server!

Use relevance matrix locate related messages given terms
  See questions/outline for Travis at bottom

1. Figure out your use-case flows
2. Make the model methods more intelligent (findOrCreate...)
3. Introduce a controller layer if deemed wise by (1)

Do I want to return a message with all responses?
Body:
  {
    "type": "Success",
    "message": "Succesfully saved author to db",
    "payload": {
      "author": "Friedrich Schiller"
    }
  }


Later:
Author names are tags
  "Private" tag means only tagged author(s) can see it
save/load feeds
  feeds table
Tags carry more weight, but all message text is searchable
  Tags and terms are different because the text is searchable


Implemented:
relevancy parameter in feed search (frontend)


Can the model do this:

What are the inputs and outputs of the model?
Input: Terms
Output: Message IDs

Can you have an ID on each [300] vector object in the model?
When you return the (records? objects?) from the model, can they have the ID?
Can they go in with the ID?
  How do they go in after being written?
